# Overview of the Analysis

The task is to anlyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. In this project, we accessed one of their datasets whcich contains reviews for a specific product. We used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. We also determined if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
